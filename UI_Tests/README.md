# Team project

The goal of this project is to design and implement automated tests for both the User Interface (UI) and Application Programming Interface (API) layers of our application. The tests will ensure reliability, stability, and performance by automating the validation of key functionality across various components.

## Key Deliverables:

### UI Automated Tests:

Create automated test scripts for the web-based UI to validate core workflows, such as user login, data entry, form submissions, navigation, and responsiveness.
Automate regression tests for new features and bug fixes, reducing manual testing time.

### API Automated Tests:

Develop automated tests for the back-end APIs to verify endpoints, response codes, data formats, and performance.
Implement end-to-end testing by simulating user actions through the API and verifying the results on the UI.

### Testing Frameworks & Tools:

UI Testing: Cypress

API Testing: Cypress

Continuous Integration (CI): GitLab CI to run tests on every code commit and deployment.
